###Description of Experiment

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 


###Summary for the tidy dataset

The final summary tidy dataset "tidydata.txt" contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

Data in dataset contains 180 rows and 68 columns for:

1. mean(): Mean value

2. std(): Standard deviation


###Identifiers

The base data is grouped by the following values to build mean value and the standard deviation std()

1. subject - The ID of the test subject

2. activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
